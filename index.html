      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a software enthusiast who wants to create cool things. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in New Jersey, but I have roots in Jalisco, Mexico and San Diego, California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to eat good food, make good drinks, and enjoy life to the fullest</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is one where I don't have to go into the office.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Salt Lake City, Utah-- but I think life is too short to stay in one place too long.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Creating has always been a passion, but I lacked true artistic talent. If I can use my critical thinking abilities to otherwise create, that would be a dream come true.</p>
